<p><img src="/images/avatar.png" class="floatpic" width="200" height="300" />
My name is Jacey Huang. I am now a third-year student studying in the College of Information Science and Electronic Engineering (<a href="http://www.isee.zju.edu.cn/">ISEE</a>), <a href="https://www.zju.edu.cn/">Zhejiang University</a>.</p>

<p>In 2019, I was admitted to the Engineering Experimental Class of Energy, Chemical and Polymer of Zhejiang University, and in the same year, I transferred to the major of Information Engineering and entered the Shannon Class of ISEE through selection. Under the tutelage of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7l8wsYgAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao/">Prof. Zhiguo Shi</a>, I finished the Student Research Training Program (SRTP) using ORB_SLAM3 to achieve visual positioning and navigation with my teammates. After that, I complemented an <a href="https://github.com/EtHereAlPlusor/ISEE-ZYNQFaceRec/">embedded face recognition system</a> for masked and unmasked faces using ZYNQ.</p>

<p>Through these three years of hard work, I will now be eligible for postgraduate exemption from ISEE and I am planning to pursue a PhD directly, working with <a href="https://yiyiliao.github.io/">Prof. Yiyi Liao</a>. My research interest lies in computer vision and its application.</p>

<p>My chinese name is é»„å˜‰æ¬£. And I was born and raised in Wanzhou District, Chongqing, China.</p>
